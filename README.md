Introduction
Flight prices can be influenced by a myriad of factors, and predicting them accurately is crucial for businesses in the travel industry. This repository presents a comprehensive approach to building a flight price prediction model using various machine learning algorithms.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Flight Price Dataset. It includes information such as date of journey, airline, source, destination, and additional details that can impact flight prices.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, converting date columns to datetime, extracting relevant features, and encoding categorical variables. This ensures the dataset is ready for training machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides insights into the distribution of key variables, helping us understand trends and patterns in the data. Visualizations are included to showcase the distribution of airlines, sources, destinations, and other relevant features.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. Extracting information from date columns and encoding categorical variables are examples of feature engineering applied in this project.

Model Selection
Several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LGBMRegressor, are considered. The Extra Trees model is identified as the optimal choice based on its performance metrics.

Model Evaluation
The selected model is evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R^2). The evaluation results demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting flight prices.

Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning
GridSearchCV is employed to fine-tune hyperparameters for the Gradient Boosting Regressor, further enhancing the model's performance.

Conclusion
The conclusion provides a business-oriented perspective on why the Extra Trees model is the preferred choice. It discusses the model's impact on decision-making, continuous improvement, and the overall benefits it brings to the business.
